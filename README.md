# tfmcp: Terraform Model Context Protocol Tool

*‚ö†Ô∏è  This project includes production-ready security features but is still under active development. While the security system provides robust protection, please review all operations carefully in production environments. ‚ö†Ô∏è*

tfmcp is a command-line tool that helps you interact with Terraform via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows LLMs to manage and operate your Terraform environments, including:

### Using Docker

When using Docker, you can run tfmcp commands like this:

```bash
# Run as MCP server (default)
docker run -it tfmcp

# Run with specific command and options
docker run -it tfmcp analyze --dir /app/example

# Mount your Terraform project directory
docker run -it -v /path/to/your/terraform:/app/terraform tfmcp --dir /app/terraform

# Set environment variables
docker run -it -e TFMCP_LOG_LEVEL=debug tfmcp
```

### Integrating with Claude Desktop

To use tfmcp with Claude Desktop:

1. If you haven't already, install tfmcp:
   ```bash
   cargo install tfmcp
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use Docker:
   ```bash
   docker build -t tfmcp .
   ```

2. Find the path to your installed tfmcp executable:
   ```bash
   which tfmcp
   ```

3. Add the following configuration to `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tfmcp": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/tfmcp",  // Replace with the actual path from step 2
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "HOME": "/Users/yourusername",  // Replace with your username
        "PATH": "/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin",
        "TERRAFORM_DIR": "/path/to/your/terraform/project"  // Optional: specify your Terraform project
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you're using Docker with Claude Desktop, you can set up the configuration like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tfmcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-v", "/path/to/your/terraform:/app/terraform", "tfmcp", "mcp"],
      "env": {
        "TERRAFORM_DIR": "/app/terraform"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Restart Claude Desktop and enable the tfmcp tool.

5. tfmcp will automatically create a sample Terraform project in `~/terraform` if one doesn't exist, ensuring Claude can start working with Terraform right away. The sample project is based on the examples included in the `example/demo` directory of this repository.

## Logs and Troubleshooting

The tfmcp server logs are available at:
```
~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-tfmcp.log
```

Common issues and solutions:

- **Claude can't connect to the server**: Make sure the path to the tfmcp executable is correct in your configuration
- **Terraform project issues**: tfmcp automatically creates a sample Terraform project if none is found
- **Method not found errors**: MCP protocol support includes resources/list and prompts/list methods
- **Docker issues**: If using Docker, ensure your container has proper volume mounts and permissions

## Environment Variables

### Core Configuration
- `TERRAFORM_DIR`: Set this to specify a custom Terraform project directory. If not set, tfmcp will use the directory provided by command line arguments, configuration files, or fall back to `~/terraform`. You can also change the project directory at runtime using the `set_terraform_directory` tool.
- `TFMCP_LOG_LEVEL`: Set to `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error` to control logging verbosity.
- `TFMCP_DEMO_MODE`: Set to `true` to enable demo mode with additional safety features.

### Security Configuration
- `TFMCP_ALLOW_DANGEROUS_OPS`: Set to `true` to enable apply/destroy operations (default: `false`)
- `TFMCP_ALLOW_AUTO_APPROVE`: Set to `true` to enable auto-approve for dangerous operations (default: `false`)
- `TFMCP_MAX_RESOURCES`: Set maximum number of resources that can be managed (default: 50)
- `TFMCP_AUDIT_ENABLED`: Set to `false` to disable audit logging (default: `true`)
- `TFMCP_AUDIT_LOG_FILE`: Custom path for audit log file (default: `~/.tfmcp/audit.log`)
- `TFMCP_AUDIT_LOG_SENSITIVE`: Set to `true` to include sensitive information in audit logs (default: `false`)

## Security Considerations

tfmcp includes comprehensive security features designed for production use:

### üîí Built-in Security Features
- **Access Controls**: Automatic blocking of production/sensitive file patterns
- **Operation Restrictions**: Dangerous operations (apply/destroy) disabled by default
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable maximum resource count protection
- **Audit Logging**: Complete operation tracking with timestamps and user identification
- **Directory Validation**: Security policy enforcement for project directories

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices
- **Default Safety**: Apply/destroy operations are disabled by default - explicitly enable only when needed
- **Review Plans**: Always review Terraform plans before applying, especially AI-generated ones
- **IAM Boundaries**: Use appropriate IAM permissions and role boundaries in cloud environments
- **Audit Monitoring**: Regularly review audit logs at `~/.tfmcp/audit.log`
- **File Patterns**: Built-in protection against accessing `prod*`, `production*`, and `secret*` patterns
- **Docker Security**: When using containers, carefully consider volume mounts and exposed data

### ‚öôÔ∏è Production Configuration
```bash
# Recommended production settings
export TFMCP_ALLOW_DANGEROUS_OPS=false    # Keep disabled for safety
export TFMCP_ALLOW_AUTO_APPROVE=false     # Require manual approval
export TFMCP_MAX_RESOURCES=10             # Limit resource scope
export TFMCP_AUDIT_ENABLED=true           # Enable audit logging
export TFMCP_AUDIT_LOG_SENSITIVE=false    # Don't log sensitive data
```
